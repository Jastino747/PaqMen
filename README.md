# PaqMen
If you know what "Pac Man" is, then you know this game. Collect all the pellets, do not let the ghost catch you, use the power up, and there you go :)
I made this imitation just to learn how is it possible to remake the "Pac Man" using existing feature of .NET Framework.

The maps and the sprites were custom made, but based on the original resource from the real "Pac Man" game.
The artificial intelligence for the ghost was entirely custom made by myself, so the ghost behaviour might be different from the original "Pac Man" game.
The background music is from TheFatRat - Less Than Three.

Take a peek at the "Paq Men" folder, for the project's source code. If you want to test the result only, simply run the .exe file inside the "0. Output" folder, and have fun :)
